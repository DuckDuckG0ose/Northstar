- ## Raw code (.py/un-compiled)
    ### NOTE: If you are just a normal user I strongly advise **AGAINST** using this 
    1. Clone the repository or click [here](https://github.com/VisualDeVenture/Northstar) or go to the Northstar Github page and download the raw code
    
        *Git clone command: `$ git clone https://github.com/VisualDeVenture/Northstar`*
    2. Install the required packages and libraries for the code to work properly
        
        *You can achieve this either by using `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` or by running Install_Requirements.bat*
    
    3. Run Debug_Window.exe as administrator or open a new Command prompt and navigate to the Northstar folder.
    
        **If you used the Debug Window you can stop here.**
    4. Use `$ Python main.py` (If the terminal crashes or displays any kind of error please make sure you are running your terminal as an administrator.)
    5. Enjoy your new found performance!
